While we usually meet on the second Sunday, we have moved our May meeting to Sunday, the 
22nd, to avoid conflict with Mother's Day.

"A Black History Story: A Renaissance Couple". Race Amity of Northern Westchester & Putnam is 
delighted to offer a slice of authentic American history.  One of our members, Patricia 
Adams, will present a recorded slideshow about her family.  With narration by Patricia and 
family photos, it is the story of her parents and their parents from the slave plantations 
of Georgia and Louisiana to graduating Phi Beta Kappa and becoming newspaper publishers.
 
Also, put June 12th on your calendar for our annual Race Amity Day celebration!  
 
Looking forward to seeing you soon! Contact <atc@westchesterbaihs.org> for zoom details.
