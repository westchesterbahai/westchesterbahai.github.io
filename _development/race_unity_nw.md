Dear friends, the next meeting will be remote over zoom.
We welcome you to join us to view the short documentary film “An American Story:  Race Amity and the Other Tradition”.  We will follow up with a group discussion to explore ways that our community can begin to heal following multiple local racist incidents within the last year.  Please bring your ideas and your questions.

Contact <atc@westchesterbaihs.org> for zoom details.
