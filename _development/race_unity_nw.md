While we usually meet on the second Sunday, we have moved our May meeting to Sunday, the 
22nd, to avoid conflict with Mother's Day.  More information coming soon!
 
Also, put June 12th on your calendar for our annual Race Amity Day celebration!  
 
Looking forward to seeing you soon! Contact <atc@westchesterbaihs.org> for zoom details.
