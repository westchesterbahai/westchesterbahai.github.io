Dear friends, 
 
Race Amity of Northern Westchester & Putnam is pleased to be sharing a booth with 
Yorktown for Justice at the Yorktown Festival & Street Fair on Sunday, October 10th.  
This event will be in lieu of our regular monthly meeting.  We will be there from 11 - 5.

As it will be Indigenous Peoples Day weekend, we are particularly proud to cosponsor 
the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers!  They will perform on the main stage 
at 11:00 and will continue by our booth.

We hope to be able to stream the performance.
 
More details will be sent as the date approaches.  We hope to see many of you there!
