Our next Zoom meeting will be Sunday, February 13th at 2:00. In honor of 
Black History Month, we are so excited to have the founders of the African 
American Archive of Columbia County come and present to us!
 
Victoria Jimpson-Fludd, Lisa Fludd-Smith, and Peter Smith of the African-American 
Archive of Columbia County will be sharing their journey in researching the history 
and genealogy of the Jimpson/Van Ness families of Kinderhook. In addition to 
their own personal history, you'll hear some interesting information about 
the Black experience in the Hudson Valley, as well as some useful tips for 
beginning your own family research.  We will follow up with a group discussion.

We will send out the Zoom link the day before.
