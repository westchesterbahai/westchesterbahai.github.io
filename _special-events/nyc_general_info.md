Firesides are conversations intended to introduce you to the Baha'i
Faith and explore answers to some of life's essential questions.  
Each thought-provoking conversation will provide you with an opportunity 
to share your thoughts, ask questions and learn about the world's most 
diverse and second most widespread religion.
