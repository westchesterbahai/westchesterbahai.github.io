This is Baha'i website of the Westchester Cluster. All documents hosted on this site are public. This 
is generated by Jekyll under Github Pages (kramdown dialect). The original web page design was
based on a fork of the [Karna Jekyll Theme](http://webjeda.com/karna-full/)

## For quick changes
* Navigate to the document you wish to edit.
* Click the "pencil" icon to make edits, click again when done.
* Submit to master. This will create a "pull request" that admins can clean up and review for posting.

## Full Local Installation (Advanced Users Only!!!)
* Fork the repository
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as master.
* Your clone should be ready and navigable under the published link.
* If you are proposing significant changes, you should push to a branch. (If you don't know what a "push" is, this
workflow probably doesn't apply to you.)
