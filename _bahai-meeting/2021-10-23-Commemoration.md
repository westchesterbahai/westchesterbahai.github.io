In commemoration of the Centenary of the Ascension of Abdu'l-Baha, please join us for 
an in-person group on "Reflections on the Covenant."  This session will explore the 
meaning and need for Baha'u'llah's Covenant in today's increasingly fractured world.  
Equally important, will be the reflections on our relationship and attitudes towards 
such a priceless Heritage. 

RSVP and COVID vaccinations are a must to keep us within guidelines.
Contact <atc@westchesterbahais.org> for host and location information to join us.
